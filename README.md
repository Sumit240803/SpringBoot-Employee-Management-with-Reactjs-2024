## Overview

This project is an Employee Management System that includes a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend. It allows for managing employee data with functionalities such as adding, updating, and deleting employee records.

## Features

- **Backend**:
  - Built with Spring Boot.
  - Provides RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on employee data.
  - Secure authentication and authorization.

- **Frontend**:
  - Built with React.
  - User-friendly interface for interacting with employee data.
  - Supports form inputs for adding and updating employee records.
  - Displays a list of employees and allows for data manipulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- Maven or Gradle (for building the Spring Boot application)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Set up the Backend**

   Navigate to the `backend` folder and build the Spring Boot application:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   Make sure to update the `application.properties` file with your database configuration.

3. **Set up the Frontend**

   Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

   Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage

- **Backend**: The backend will be running on `http://localhost:8080`. You can use tools like Postman to interact with the API endpoints.

- **Frontend**: The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. Use the web interface to manage employee data.
